# Regression Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and resources for Machine Learning Assignment. The assignment explores regression analysis techniques and multi-class classification using Python.

## Overview

The assignment focuses on three key tasks:
1. **Linear Regression:** Predicting restaurant profits based on city population.
2. **Logistic Regression:** Classifying job applicants based on their interview scores.
3. **Multi-Class Classification:** Implementing strategies like One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One for multi-class datasets using logistic regression.

Graduate students further extend the assignment by solving a multi-class classification problem with an external dataset.

## Files in the Repository

- **`logisticregressiondata.csv`:** Dataset for logistic regression tasks.
- **`regressiondata.csv`:** Dataset for linear regression tasks.
